# Feel free to contribute.

Please bear in mind this project is barely maintained.

If making a PR I need a good explanation of what the intended change
is for.

If it's not clear (to me) what the change is doing then I have no time
to review and test and will more than likely close the PR, see
previous paragraph.

Reach out via issue explaining what you propose before doing any work.

If you are looking for language completion see [Excel Live Server]
(untested by me).
